        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Early Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Early lung cancer often shows no symptoms. When symptoms do arise, they are typically nonspecific respiratory problems – coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain – that can differ from person to person. Many individuals experience coughing that either begins suddenly or increases in frequency and intensity. Around 25% of patients cough up blood, ranging from small streaks to larger amounts. Approximately 50% of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience shortness of breath, and 25-50% report persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.</p>

        <section class="systemic-symptoms">
            <h2>Systemic Symptoms</h2>
            <p>In addition to respiratory symptoms, some people experience systemic symptoms including loss of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, fever, and night sweats.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="location-specific-symptoms">
            <h2>Location-Specific Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Certain symptoms can suggest the presence of tumors in specific locations. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tumors in the thorax can obstruct the trachea, causing breathing problems.</li>
                <li>Difficulty swallowing may occur when tumors compress the esophagus.</li>
                <li>Hoarseness may be caused by tumors disrupting the larynx's nerves.</li>
                <li>Shoulder pain and destruction of the topmost ribs may be present in tumors at the top of the lung (Pancoast tumors).</li>
                <li>Swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone may indicate tumor spread within the chest.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="metastatic-symptoms">
            <h2>Metastatic Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Lung cancer can also metastasize to other parts of the body, with symptoms depending on the affected site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brain metastases can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits.</li>
                <li>Bone metastases lead to pain, fractures, and possible spinal cord compression.</li>
                <li>Metastasis to the liver can cause liver enlargement, pain, fever, and weight loss.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="paraneoplastic-syndromes">
            <h2>Paraneoplastic Syndromes</h2>
            <p>Lung tumors may also cause the release of hormones, leading to a variety of unusual symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and mental confusion.</li>
                <li>Hypokalemia (low potassium) and hyponatremia (low sodium) are common due to inappropriate hormone secretion.</li>
                <li>Up to 30% of lung cancer patients experience nail clubbing, and up to 10% may have hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, paraneoplastic blood clotting, including venous thrombophlebitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, may occur in some individuals.</p>
